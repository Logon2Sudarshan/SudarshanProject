Hello Uttam,

I trust this message finds you well. I'd like to discuss my role in the Investment Planning Tool. Although I was part of the entire IPT development last year, this year, due to other assignments, I joined the team a bit later. My focus has primarily been on SSIS package automation and IPT production planning during my time here. According to the schedule, we seem to be on track for production deployment. I would appreciate your valuable feedback on my contributions, as it serves as inspiration for me to deliver even better work. Thank you for all your support.

Best regards.
