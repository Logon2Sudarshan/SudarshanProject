Hello Uttam,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss my role in the Investment Planning Tool. Although I actively participated in its development last year, I joined the team later this year due to other assignments. My recent focus has been on SSIS package automation and IPT production planning. According to the schedule, we should be on track for production deployment. I would appreciate your valuable feedback on my contributions, as it will motivate me to deliver even better work. Thank you for your ongoing support.

Best regards.
