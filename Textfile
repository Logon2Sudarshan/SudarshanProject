Subject: Request for Feedback on my Contribution to Investment Planning Tool

Hi Uttam,

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to discuss my involvement in the Investment Planning Tool. Although I played a key role in the complete development of IPT last year, due to other assignments, I joined the team later this year. During my time here, I primarily focused on SSIS package automation and IPT production planning.

I have consistently given my best effort to the team, and I believe we are on track for the production deployment as per the schedule. Now, I would appreciate it if you could take a moment to provide valuable feedback on my contributions. Your insights will inspire me to continue delivering high-quality work.

Thank you for all your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
